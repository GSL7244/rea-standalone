# REA for DeepSeek Harness

中文安装说明：[README.zh-CN.md](README.zh-CN.md)

An experimental Harness bundle candidate exposing REA's existing local MCP server
as `mcp__rea__*` tools, using the current `dsh.bundle`/Cordis composition API.
The full REA engine remains authoritative; this adapter has no second reverse-
engineering engine or parallel tool schema to keep synchronized.

## Desktop candidate prerequisites and host launch

Native Desktop support remains unqualified. Immutable 0.2.0 uses Electron's
application executable as the MCP child and must not be installed for Desktop.
Candidate 0.2.1 fixes that selection but is not a qualified published release.
The commands and URLs below document candidate qualification, not a supported
Desktop installation recommendation.

Before enabling the candidate, provide an existing standalone Node executable
accepted by REA. Installing Node does not set `REA_DSH_NODE_PATH`; the variable
must reach the Desktop host process. On macOS, fully quit Desktop, then launch
its installed executable directly from the same terminal:

```sh
# Set both paths to existing caller-owned installations; no runtime is installed.
REA_DSH_NODE_PATH="/absolute/path/to/node"
DSH_DESKTOP_APP="/absolute/path/to/DeepSeek Harness.app"
DSH_DESKTOP_EXECUTABLE="$(/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Print :CFBundleExecutable' "$DSH_DESKTOP_APP/Contents/Info.plist")"
export REA_DSH_NODE_PATH
"$REA_DSH_NODE_PATH" --version
"$DSH_DESKTOP_APP/Contents/MacOS/$DSH_DESKTOP_EXECUTABLE"
```

Keep using this explicit host launch while qualifying the candidate. Starting
Desktop later from Finder does not inherit this terminal's exported variable.
Enabling a bundle or running the recovery helper does not configure the host
variable. This launch procedure and native runtime tool discovery remain
unverified; confirm `mcp__rea__*` tools in a live session before relying on it.

## Desktop installed the bundle but did not activate it

Recovery resolves `DSH_HOME` with Harness's rules: blank values use `~/.dsh`,
`~`, `~/` and `~\` prefixes expand to the home directory, and relative paths
resolve from the command's working directory. Nonblank spaces are preserved.

Symptoms: `~/.dsh/profiles/desktop/package.json` lists
`dsh-rea-bundle` in `dependencies`, but **not** in
`dsh.profile.bundles`. There are no `mcp__rea__*` tools in the live session. The stored `cordis.yml` is an empty loader root and does not describe effective composition.

The upstream Harness plugin manager separates **install** from **enable now**; closing the
post-install dialog without enabling can leave an installed, disabled bundle.
Prefer **Desktop → Plugins → Installed plugins → dsh-rea-bundle → Enable**,
then fully quit and relaunch with the host environment described above.

The packaged recovery helper is included in candidate 0.2.1. The immutable
0.2.0 launcher is unsuitable for Electron Desktop; its enable switch does not
repair that launch behavior. Wait for a qualified fixed release.

If the UI toggle is missing or unusable, use this repository's
[`activate-installed.mjs`](scripts/activate-installed.mjs) recovery script
on your **local Mac only**. It has a read-only default and makes no pnpm,
network, or server calls. Its only opt-in mutation backs up the original
Desktop `package.json` and appends `dsh-rea-bundle` once to the ordered
bundle list; other plugins, dependencies, and lock files remain unchanged.

```sh
# Review the source before executing it.
node "$HOME/.dsh/profiles/desktop/node_modules/dsh-rea-bundle/scripts/activate-installed.mjs" --status

# Fully quit DeepSeek Harness Desktop first:
node "$HOME/.dsh/profiles/desktop/node_modules/dsh-rea-bundle/scripts/activate-installed.mjs" --activate

# Relaunch Desktop, inspect mcp__rea__* tools in a live session.
# This command checks stored selection only:
node "$HOME/.dsh/profiles/desktop/node_modules/dsh-rea-bundle/scripts/activate-installed.mjs" --status
```

Successful activation prints the exact `package.json.rea-backup-...`
backup path. Re-running `--activate` is idempotent. No extra `dsh` CLI
installation or `allowBuilds` change is required. To restore the old
profile, fully quit Desktop and restore the byte-for-byte original backup.
Stored selection does not prove effective runtime composition. `--verify`
reports that runtime state as unverified and exits nonzero until a supported
inspection path is qualified. Confirm tool discovery in a live Desktop session. A prior local REA 6.4.0
handshake listed 170 tools, which is **not a universal runtime guarantee**.

## Candidate Desktop package sources (not yet qualified/published)

**Paste this exact URL**, including the `#dsh-plugin-v0.2.1` tag,
into DeepSeek Harness Desktop → **Plugins → Add plugin**:

```text
https://github.com/morluto/rea#dsh-plugin-v0.2.1
```

Do **not** paste the repository's untagged URL. It resolves to the
build-required `rea-agents` CLI on `main` and triggers
`ERR_PNPM_GIT_DEP_PREPARE_NOT_ALLOWED`. The **plugin tag** contains only
`dsh-rea-bundle` files at the repository root, including `dsh.bundle`,
and has no install-time scripts. This uses the Git-hosted package support in
the current Desktop plugin manager; it does not require `allowBuilds`.

Alternatively paste the versioned GitHub Release tarball URL directly:

```text
https://github.com/morluto/rea/releases/download/dsh-v0.2.1/dsh-rea-bundle-0.2.1.tgz
```

The URL is a plugin-install source, not a page to open in the browser.
After candidate installation, complete the standalone Node host setup above,
enable **dsh-rea-bundle**, and relaunch Desktop with that host environment.
If an earlier mistaken installation created a `rea-agents` Git dependency,
remove only that item (preserving other plugins) before retrying.
For the separate `web` CLI profile, substitute `--profile web` in
`dsh plugin` commands; Desktop uses its own `desktop` profile.

## Requirements

- A DeepSeek Harness installation with the `dsh` CLI and `pnpm` on `PATH`.
- Node.js accepted by REA: `^22.19.0 || ^24.11.0 || >=26.0.0`.
- Optional analysis engines (Ghidra, IDA, JADX, etc.) remain **bring-your-own**.
- Permission to run locally installed code and to analyze the chosen target.

## Install: current DeepSeek Harness CLI (macOS / Linux)

Use a published GitHub Release **tarball** for a reproducible, build-free
install. As of 2026-10-13, npm's `@deepseek-ai/dsh@latest` dist-tag is
`0.2.0-rc.2`; upstream `master` can be newer/experimental. This procedure
uses the current `dsh plugin --profile <name> add ...` syntax and pins
this repository's REA plugin to release `dsh-v0.2.1`.

Prerequisites: a supported Node.js runtime, npm, network access on first
installation, and `pnpm` for plugin management. The bundle does not install
optional Ghidra, IDA or other analysis engines.

```sh
# Node.js: ^22.19, ^24.11, or >=26; macOS/Linux
npm install --global @deepseek-ai/dsh@latest pnpm@11

curl -fL --retry 3 --output dsh-rea-bundle-0.2.1.tgz https://github.com/morluto/rea/releases/download/dsh-v0.2.1/dsh-rea-bundle-0.2.1.tgz
curl -fL --retry 3 --output SHA256SUMS https://github.com/morluto/rea/releases/download/dsh-v0.2.1/SHA256SUMS
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS

dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-rea-bundle-0.2.1.tgz
dsh --profile web --dump-config
dsh --profile web
```

The SHA-256 value above is the published GitHub release asset digest.
Do not continue if checksum verification fails. `--dump-config` is
a read-only **composition inspection**, not a successful live model-call test.
It should show a `dsh-rea-bundle` layer and `rea-launcher` / `rea-mcp` rows.
Restart your existing Harness process after installing.

To inspect the CLI version and npm's current distribution tags:

```sh
dsh --version
npm view @deepseek-ai/dsh dist-tags --json
```

### Install from a local checkout (development)

This alternative is for a cloned repository, **not** a GitHub URL with an
unverified subdirectory fragment. Linked packages keep their own
`node_modules`, so install the adapter's dependency before linking:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/morluto/rea.git
cd rea
npm install --prefix integrations/deepseek-harness --ignore-scripts
dsh plugin --profile web add "$(pwd)/integrations/deepseek-harness"
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

To run the fork's compiled REA rather than the pinned npm runtime,
follow the instructions in the next section.

### DeepSeek Harness Desktop: fix `ERR_PNPM_GIT_DEP_PREPARE_NOT_ALLOWED`

**Cause.** If the error names `rea-agents@6.4.0` and downloads a Git archive
like `https://codeload.github.com/morluto/rea/tar.gz/<commit>`, the
Desktop plugin manager was given the **root REA repository** rather than the
installable `dsh-rea-bundle` package. Root `rea-agents` has a Git
`prepare` script. pnpm deliberately refuses it under its supply-chain
policy, and the root package does not declare `dsh.bundle`. Do **not** add
the root package to `allowBuilds`: it still would not be a Harness bundle.

**Fix with the Desktop UI** (requires no pnpm or npm CLI installation):

```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/.dsh/plugin-packages"
curl -fL --retry 3 -o "$HOME/.dsh/plugin-packages/dsh-rea-bundle-0.2.1.tgz" \
  https://github.com/morluto/rea/releases/download/dsh-v0.2.1/dsh-rea-bundle-0.2.1.tgz
curl -fL --retry 3 --output "$HOME/.dsh/plugin-packages/SHA256SUMS" https://github.com/morluto/rea/releases/download/dsh-v0.2.1/SHA256SUMS
(cd "$HOME/.dsh/plugin-packages" && shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS)
printf '%s\n' "$HOME/.dsh/plugin-packages/dsh-rea-bundle-0.2.1.tgz"
```

1. Open **DeepSeek Harness Desktop → Plugins → Add plugin** (the sidebar's
   Plugins page), and paste the **absolute local `.tgz` path** printed by
   the final command. Do **not** paste the untagged repository URL. Tagged plugin Git URLs and versioned Release tarballs are supported alternatives.
2. Install and enable **`dsh-rea-bundle`**, then completely quit and
   reopen Desktop. Inspect its plugin list for the `rea-launcher` and
   `rea-mcp` rows. If a prior `rea setup --client dsh` created a
   home-level `rea-mcp` patch, back up the patch and remove only that
   obsolete REA row: home patches override profile bundle configuration.
3. If Desktop's `~/.dsh/profiles/desktop/package.json` contains a direct
   `rea-agents` dependency referencing `xxxxxwater/rea` on GitHub,
   back up the profile, then remove **only that incorrect direct dependency**
   via the Desktop-bundled plugin manager, not by deleting the whole profile
   or editing `allowBuilds`. An installation that failed before saving
   the dependency may have nothing to remove.

**Alternative from a cloned REA checkout:**

```sh
bash integrations/deepseek-harness/scripts/prepare-desktop-install.sh
```

That script downloads the pinned GitHub Release asset, validates SHA-256,
keeps the archive in `$DSH_HOME/plugin-packages` (default `~/.dsh`),
and prints the path to paste into the Desktop installer. It does not mutate
the Desktop profile. After installing Desktop's **own** `dsh` command from
the application menu **Manage dsh Command…**, fully quit Desktop and
optionally run:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile desktop add "$HOME/.dsh/plugin-packages/dsh-rea-bundle-0.2.1.tgz"
```

A standalone `npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh` launcher may reject this
with `profile "desktop" is managed exclusively by the Electron application`.
Use the Desktop Plugins UI or its app-bundled CLI, not `dsh --profile
desktop` (which tries to boot the reserved profile).

### Desktop versus CLI

The commands above target the `web` **CLI profile**. A Desktop application
manages its own installed profile; install the same `dsh-rea-bundle-0.2.1.tgz`
through the Desktop application's supported plugin installer when available.
Do **not** run `dsh --profile desktop` (that name is reserved).
Native Desktop installation, including Intel macOS builds, needs validation
in the actual Desktop client and is not established by CLI CI.

### Run this fork's REA implementation

To run the code checked out from **xxxxxwater/rea** rather than upstream npm:

```sh
cd /absolute/path/to/rea
npm ci
npm run build:cached
export REA_DSH_ENTRYPOINT="$(pwd)/scripts/rea.mjs"
dsh --profile web
```

The environment variable must be an **absolute path** to an existing
`scripts/rea.mjs`. The plugin starts it with the Harness host's active
Node executable (`process.execPath`) and argument `mcp`, without `npx`,
shell interpolation, implicit upgrades, or downloads. A missing local
`dist/mcp/main.js` makes REA fail closed with its build instructions.

**Desktop users:** install into the active Desktop plugin profile through
the application/plugin manager, and ensure host-level overrides reach the
Desktop process. Do not assume Desktop runs CLI `--profile web`. In the
latest Harness CLI, `desktop` is a reserved profile name, not a normal
`dsh --profile desktop` target.

## Architecture and behavior

Two plugin rows are contributed to Harness composition:

1. `rea-launcher` provides the scoped Cordis `reaLauncher` service.
2. `rea-mcp` injects that service into the built-in
   `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client` over local `stdio`, which registers
   tools under `mcp__rea__<tool_name>` and handles disposal/reconnection.

By default the bundle sets `REA_DSH_SCHEMA_PROFILE=compact`. This reduces
model-facing schema bytes; REA still validates canonical full inputs. Set
`REA_DSH_SCHEMA_PROFILE=full` in the Harness host environment to advertise
full tool schemas. Unsupported values fail startup. `REA_DSH_TOOL_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS`
sets the client deadline from 1 through 2147483647 milliseconds; the default
is 2147483647 milliseconds (about 25 days). This is a finite client timer,
not a guarantee that every analysis plus cleanup finishes within that time.

Example Harness prompt:

> Use REA to analyze the JavaScript application at /absolute/path/app.js;
> identify observations, derivations, and unresolved unknowns with evidence.

REA's local security and authority constraints still apply. Installing the
bundle does not authorize injection, process mutation, privileged operations,
or a target you are not permitted to analyze.

The launcher preserves documented provider settings, including JADX's
`JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`, `JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS` and `_JAVA_OPTIONS`. Its environment is
a separate writable snapshot for Harness configuration normalization;
the host's original environment is unchanged. Local entrypoint overrides are
resolved by the filesystem before passing them to Node, preserving the selected
file through symlink and `..` traversal. Electron executable aliases are rejected
using file identity; the selected standalone Node lookup path stays intact.

## Migrating from `rea setup --client dsh`

The legacy CLI setup places a `rea-mcp` row in
`$DSH_HOME/cordis.patch.yml`. **Home patch layers win over bundle layers**.
Back up that file, then remove only its legacy `rea-mcp` insertion, preserving
all unrelated configuration. Restart Harness. Keeping the same row ID avoids
creating a second default `rea` MCP namespace, but the legacy row will hide
this bundle until removed.

## Verify, upgrade and uninstall

```sh
# Inspect the effective profile without starting the app
dsh --profile web --dump-config

# Confirm the plugin is installed in this profile
dsh plugin --profile web why dsh-rea-bundle

# Uninstall the plugin and its bundle layer
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-rea-bundle
```

To upgrade the REA plugin, download the **new versioned release archive**
and run `dsh plugin --profile web add /absolute/path/to/new-bundle.tgz`.
Re-running `pnpm update` against an old local tarball cannot discover new
GitHub Releases. To upgrade the Harness CLI, use
`npm install --global @deepseek-ai/dsh@latest`, then restart it.

The dump should identify the `dsh-rea-bundle` layer, `rea-launcher`
and `rea-mcp`. If it identifies a home-patch override, migrate as above.
If it says the launcher is missing, check the npm dependency or local
`REA_DSH_ENTRYPOINT`. If REA says `dist/mcp/main.js` is missing, build
the fork checkout. Check target-engine prerequisites separately.

## Versioned GitHub release

GitHub Release `dsh-v0.2.1` is prepared for publication with the build-free
`dsh-rea-bundle-0.2.1.tgz` file. Later `dsh-v*` releases use separate,
versioned archives. The root REA npm/MCP Registry release process remains
separate and unchanged. Publication requires an explicit manual workflow run
with `publish_plugin=true` and the repository opt-in `REA_DSH_PUBLISH=true`;
main pushes and PRs do not publish the candidate.

## Tests and verification scope

```sh
node --test integrations/deepseek-harness/tests/*.test.mjs
node integrations/deepseek-harness/scripts/verify-package.mjs
```

GitHub Actions also checks npm pack contents, real packaged REA MCP
initialization/tool discovery, and latest-upstream Harness bundle composition.
A successful config dump alone does **not** establish a live DeepSeek model
API call, a Desktop GUI integration, or access to optional Ghidra/IDA/JEB.
These require separate end-to-end acceptance on the target system.

Version 0.2.1 is a release candidate; its URLs become available only after publication.
For Electron hosts, set `REA_DSH_NODE_PATH` to an installed standalone Node executable.
`REA_DSH_TOOL_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS` selects the client timer (default 2147483647 ms);
choose a value longer than the operation analysis budget and cleanup. Operations
at the maximum timer boundary need a direct REA workflow because the client timer
cannot exceed that boundary. Live native Desktop composition remains unverified.

The compatibility workflow also owns `scripts/smoke-harness-bundle.mjs`. It
loads the installed bundle through the built Harness profile boot/Loader,
evaluates the bundle's service expressions there, discovers REA tools, runs a
bounded JavaScript analysis and reads one retained module page without an LLM
or API key. This workflow passed locally against upstream commit
`571902028a75c64c1d767f4ae5fd099485f0ddf0`, including shutdown. Actual Electron
44.7.0 RunAsNode host discovery and analysis also passed with an explicit
standalone Node path. Native Windows/macOS Desktop GUI installation and
composition remain separately unqualified.
